**James Lee Hagedorn** (born August 4, 1962) is an American politician from
the state of Minnesota. A Republican, he is a member of the United States
House of Representatives from Minnesota's 1st congressional district.[1] The
district covers much of the southern third of the state and includes
Rochester, Austin and Mankato.

Hagedorn was born in Blue Earth, Minnesota in 1962,[2] the son of former
United States Representative Tom Hagedorn and Kathleen (née Mittlestadt).[3]
He was raised between family farm near Truman, Minnesota and Washington D.C.,
while his father served in Congress from 1975 to 1983.[4][5] Hagedorn attended
George Mason University where he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1993.[

Following college, Hagedorn served as a legislative assistant to Minnesota
Congressman Arlan Stangeland.[ _citation needed_ ]

Hagedorn worked in the United States Department of the Treasury as Director
for Legislative and Public Affairs for the Financial Management Service from
1991 to 1998, and later as Congressional Affairs Officer for the Bureau of
Engraving and Printing.[6][7]

He previously ran for the 1st congressional district seat in the 2014 and 2016
elections, losing to incumbent Tim Walz on both occasions. In the 2018
elections, with Walz giving up the seat to make a successful run for Governor
of Minnesota, Hagedorn defeated Daniel Feehan.[1]

Between 2002 and 2012, Hagedorn published a blog titled "Mr. Conservative"
where he had a history of controversial articles and statements, including
birtherism, sexist insults, derogatory reference to a wheelchair-bound
veteran, and joking about the death of a political opponent. He issued a
"sincere and heartfelt apology" during his 2014 campaign; however during the
2018 campaign, representatives of the National Republican Congressional
Committee claimed no knowledge of this history, and later characterized the
material as "inappropriate".[12][13][14]

While never expressing any explicit animosity to Jews, Hagedorn has however
been criticized for using antisemitic tropes.[15] In 2018, the National
Republican Congressional Committee ran an advertisement accusing Hagedorn's
opponent, Dan Feehan, as well as Colin Kaepernick and “left-wing mobs paid to
riot in the streets”, of being "owned" by Jewish philanthropist George
Soros.[16] In 2008, Hagedorn wrote (approvingly) in his blog that former
Democratic Senator Joe Lieberman supported the Iraq War because he is
Jewish.[12]
