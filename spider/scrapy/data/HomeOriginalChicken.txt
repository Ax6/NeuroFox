**Home Original Chicken Co. Ltd** (simplified Chinese: 老乡鸡集团; traditional
Chinese: 老鄉雞集團; pinyin: _Lǎoxiāng jī jítuán_ "Hometown Chicken") is a Chinese
fast food chain headquartered in Hefei, Anhui.[1]

Shu Congxuan (Chinese: 束从轩) founded the company and, as of 2013, is its
director. As of that year, it was the largest fast-food company in Anhui
Province.[2] As of 2015, the company has over 240 restaurants in Anhui.[3]

Shu Congxuan, a chicken breeder, decided to start a fast food chain after
attending a three-day course in 1999.[2] the company was established in
2003.[4] The chain was originally called **FEIXI The Old Hens** [ _sic_ ]
(肥西老母鸡; _Féixī lǎo mǔjī_ "Feixi Old Hens"), after an Anhui dish.[2] The full
corporate name in Chinese was 安徽肥西老母鸡集团, and the company previously had its
headquarters in the New Cityscape Plaza (新都会购物广场; _Xīndūhuì Gòuwùguǎngchǎng_ )
shopping mall in Hefei.[5][6] By 2011 the Anhui-area authorities designated
the restaurant chain as a "Prestigious Chinese Brand".[4] It later moved its
headquarters to another place in Hefei.[7]

In 2011 a consulting firm suggested that the restaurant chain change its name.
It suggested using a three character name since a five-character name would be
lengthy.[4] The change was also made because Chinese from other provinces were
unfamiliar with the old name. The chain received its current name in March
2012.[2] There was an initial outcry when the names of the locations were
changed, but the company continued its success after the name change.[4]
