**KLG** (Chinese: 快樂雞; pinyin: _Kuàilèjī_ in Taiwan; referred to as _Kuai Le
Gee_ in Malaysia, meaning "Happy Chicken") is a fast food chain in Taiwan,
headquartered in Fengyuan District, Taichung.[1]

It is a fast food restaurant chain in Malaysia, Taiwan, and mainland China,
which has several similarities with KFC. The lettering of KLG uses the same
font and colour as KFC; the logo depicts a plump chicken wearing a bow tie.

In Malaysia, there were several outlets in Ipoh, Penang (near Farlim) and
Langkawi Island.

KLG's menu is similar to KFC's, with fried chicken, french fries, chicken
burgers and soft drinks.
