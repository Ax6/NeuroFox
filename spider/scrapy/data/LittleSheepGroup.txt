**Little Sheep Group Limited** is a company founded in 1999 in Baotou, Inner
Mongolia, China. It specializes in operating hot pot restaurants, condiment
and meat processing.

Little Sheep currently has over 300 chain restaurants in China (including Hong
Kong, Macau and Taiwan) and also the United States, Japan and Canada. In 2007,
it was awarded the most popular Chinese hot pot restaurant by Chinese
Restaurant Association. It was listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange in
2008.[1]

Little Sheep posted Â¥2 billion in revenues in 2010, or 2% of dining-out
receipts in China, according to Pei Liang, secretary-general of the China
Chain Store & Franchise Association.[2]

In 2011, Little Sheep was sold to Yum! Brands Inc, a U.S.-based fast food
franchise conglomerate (headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky). Yum agreed in
May 2011 to acquire Little Sheep for $587 million; however, the deal was
delayed for four months as the Chinese Ministry of Commerce conducted an
antitrust investigation.[3] Little Sheep was delisted from Hong Kong Exchange
in February 2012 in the end. [4] In 2016, Yum! Brands spun off their Chinese
operations into Yum China, which includes Little Sheep.[5]
