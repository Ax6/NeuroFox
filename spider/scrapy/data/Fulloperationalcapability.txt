In military acquisition, **full operational capability (FOC)** is the
completion of a development effort.

For the United States Department of Defense military acquisition FOC is
defined as " _in general attained when all units and/or organizations in the
force structure scheduled to receive a system have received it and have the
ability to employ and maintain it. The specifics for any particular system FOC
are defined in that systemâ€™s Capability Development Document (CDD) and
Capability Production Document (CPD)_."[1]

FOC is a certification event marking completion of training, providing
maintenance facilities, and end of planned production of the item. This does
not preclude additional orders to obtain the item outside that contract or
after that contract FOC.
