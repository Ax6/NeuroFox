**Volatilization** is the process whereby a dissolved sample is vaporised. In
atomic spectroscopy this is usually a two-step process. The analyte is turned
into small droplets in a nebuliser which are entrained in a gas flow which is
in turn volatilised in a high temperature flame in the case of AAS or
volatilised in a gas plasma torch in the case of ICP spectroscopy.

**Herbicide volatilisation** refers to evaporation or sublimation of a
volatile herbicide. The effect of gaseous chemical is lost at its intended
place of application and may move downwind and affect other plants not
intended to be affected causing crop damage. Herbicides vary in their
susceptibility to volatilisation. Prompt incorporation of the herbicide into
the soil may reduce or prevent volatilisation. Wind, temperature, and humidity
also affect the rate of volatilisation with humidity reducing in. 2,4-D and
dicamba are commonly used chemicals that are known to be subject to
volatilisation[1] but there are many others.[2] Application of herbicides
later in the season to protect herbicide-resistant genetically modified plants
increases the risk of volatilisation as the temperature is higher and
incorporation into the soil impractical.[1]

Herbicide applied as a powder or a mist can also drift in the wind in solid
form as dust or liquid form as tiny drops. However, a transformation of known
herbicides, such as glyphosate, dicamba or MCPA, into the form of herbicidal
ionic liquids proved to be a solution to this particular problem[3], since
herbicidal ionic systems express lower susceptibility to volatilisation. [4]
