Featured articles in Wikipedia

Featured articles are considered to be some of the best articles Wikipedia has
to offer, as determined by Wikipedia's editors. They are used by editors as
examples for writing other articles. Before being listed here, articles are
reviewed as featured article candidates for accuracy, neutrality,
completeness, and style, according to our featured article criteria. There are
**5,627** featured articles out of 5,927,706 articles on the English Wikipedia
(~0.1% are featured). Thus, about one in 1,050 of all Wikipedia articles are
listed here. Articles that no longer meet the criteria can be proposed for
improvement or removal at featured article review.

On non-mobile versions of our website, a small bronze star icon (![This star
symbolizes the featured content on
Wikipedia.](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e7/Cscr-
featured.svg/15px-Cscr-featured.svg.png)) on the top right corner of an
article's page indicates that the article is featured. On most smartphones and
tablets you can also select "Request Desktop Site" to see this line (do a
search to find out how). Additionally, if the current article is featured in
another language, a star will appear next to the corresponding entry in the
Languages list in the sidebar (a user preference allows toggling this on/off
under _Gadgets_ > _Appearance_ ).
