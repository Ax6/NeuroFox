have been highly successful at Louisiana Tech and who have distinguished
themselves professionally.[1] To be eligible for induction into the Louisiana
Tech Athletic Hall of Fame, an athlete must have completed his or her college
eligibility at least five years prior to the selection, and coaches and
administrators must have completed their careers at Louisiana Tech at least
three years before induction.
