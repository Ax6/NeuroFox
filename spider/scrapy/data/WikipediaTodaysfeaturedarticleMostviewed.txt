This **TFA STATS** page is an attempt to recognise Wikipedia's most viewed
today's featured articles. Articles are listed below based on page views
surpassing 100,000 hits on the day of the article's appearance on the Main
Page. Although Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was Wikipedia's first Featured Article
to be featured on the Main Page, page view statistics were not tracked until
December 2007. As a result, the page views listed below do not include TFAs
from 2004 to 2007.

Please do not see this list as a competition, but rather a celebration of some
of the most popular main page featured articles. The list may be helpful for
determining correlations between reader views and topics featured on the main
page, in relation to the date selected.
