**Peacock Productions** is a long-form production unit of NBC News. The
division, established on July 15, 2007, produces factual programming such as
news specials, documentary specials, and reality series. While some of its
productions do air on other NBCUniversal outlets (such as the NBC network and
MSNBC), it produces programs for competing broadcasters as well, such as the
networks of A&E Networks and Discovery among others. Peacock has served as an
incubator for new production technologies that have later been adopted by NBC
News, such as tapeless recording.[1]

Peacock was established on July 15, 2007 by the merger of NBC News Productions
& NBC Media Productions, along with the staff of NBC's newsmagazine
_Dateline_. The merger came in response to the growing popularity of non-
fiction programming on television (with a particular emphasis on cable
channels and digital outlets), and in the wake of a recent series of budget
cuts at NBC Universal that affected NBC News's long-form production units[2]

In May 2012, Marc Victor was placed in charged of the newly formed TOMORROW
production division of Peacock.[3]

In 2013, Peacock produced _Skywire Live_ for Discovery Channel, a live special
that featured Nik Wallenda's crossing of the Little Colorado River gorge near
Grand Canyon National Park.[1]

Peacock Productions is located at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York City.
