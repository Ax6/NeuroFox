A **keel** or **carina** (plural carinae) in bird anatomy is an extension of
the sternum (breastbone) which runs axially along the midline of the sternum
and extends outward, perpendicular to the plane of the ribs. The keel provides
an anchor to which a bird's wing muscles attach, thereby providing adequate
leverage for flight. Keels do not exist on all birds; in particular, some
flightless birds lack a keel structure.

Historically, the presence or absence of a pronounced keel structure was used
as a broad classification of birds into two orders: Carinatae (from _carina_ ,
"keel"), having a pronounced keel; and ratites (from _ratis_ , "raft" â€”
referring to the flatness of the sternum), having a subtle keel structure or
lacking one entirely. However, this classification has fallen into disuse as
evolutionary studies have shown that many flightless birds have evolved from
flighted birds.

Penguins, although flightless, possess a keel bone. This skeleton of an
African penguin on display at the Museum of Osteology possesses a keel.
