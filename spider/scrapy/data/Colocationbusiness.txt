**Colocation** (or **co-location** ) is the act of placing multiple (sometimes
related) entities within a single location.

Colocation is often used in the data sourcing industry to mean off-site data
storage, usually in a data center. This is very important for businesses since
the loss of data can be crucial for companies of any size, up to and including
disciplinary action for employees or loss of their job.[3] An unexpected loss
in data can result from fires, earthquakes, floods, or any sort of natural
disaster.

Data colocation technology began to take hold in the telecommunications
industry. Colocation enables multiple customers to access network, server, and
data storage space, connecting them to a variety of service providers.[4]
