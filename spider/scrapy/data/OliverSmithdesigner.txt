**Oliver Smith** (February 13, 1918 – January 23, 1994) was an American scenic
designer and interior designer.

Born in Waupun, Wisconsin, Smith attended Penn State, after which he moved to
New York City and began to form friendships that blossomed into working
relationships with such talents as Leonard Bernstein, Jerome Robbins, Carson
McCullers, and Agnes de Mille. In his early 20s he lived at February House in
Brooklyn with a coterie of famous people centered on George Davis and W. H.
Auden. He tended the furnace, washed the dishes, and soothed the tempers of
both residents and visitors. His career was launched with his designs for
Léonide Massine's ballet _Saratoga_ in 1941 and de Mille's _Rodeo_ in 1942.

Smith designed dozens of Broadway musicals, films ( _Guys and Dolls_ , _The
Band Wagon_ , _Oklahoma!_ , _Porgy and Bess_ ), and operas ( _La Traviata_ ).
His association with the American Ballet Theatre began in 1944, when he
collaborated with Robbins and Bernstein on _Fancy Free_ , which served as the
inspiration for _On the Town_. The following year, he became Co-Director of
ABT with Lucia Chase, a position he held until 1980. He designed the sets for
ABT's complete 1967 production of _Swan Lake_ , the first full-length version
mounted by an American company.

Smith also trained young designers for many years, serving on the faculty of
New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where he taught master classes
in scenic design.

Throughout his career, Smith was nominated for twenty-five Tony Awards, often
multiple times in the same year, and won ten. He was nominated for the Academy
Award for Best Art Direction for his work on _Guys and Dolls_.

Smith was inducted into the American Theatre Hall of Fame in 1981.[1] In 2011,
Smith was inducted into the National Museum of Dance's Mr. & Mrs. Cornelius
Vanderbilt Whitney Hall of Fame.

Smith redesigned the ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel (New York City
Landmark and Interior Landmark), New York, in the early 1960s.

Smith died of emphysema in Brooklyn, New York.
