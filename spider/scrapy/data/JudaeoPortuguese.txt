**Judaeo-Portuguese** , or **Lusitanic** , is the extinct Jewish language that
was used by the Jews of Portugal.

It was the vernacular of Sephardi Jews in Portugal before the 16th century and
also in many places of the Portuguese Jewish diaspora. Its texts were written
in the Hebrew script ( _aljamiado portuguÃªs_ ) or the Latin alphabet.

As Portuguese Jews intermarried with other expelled Sephards, the language
influenced the nearby Judeo-Spanish. Close similarity to Standard Portuguese
made Judeo-Portuguese go extinct in Portugal, having survived in everyday
usage in the diaspora until the late 18th/early 19th century. Judeo-Portuguese
influenced the Papiamento and Saramaccan languages.
