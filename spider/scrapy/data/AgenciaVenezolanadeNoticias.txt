**Agencia Venezolana de Noticias** ( **AVN** ) is the national news agency of
Venezuela. It is part of the Ministry of Popular Power for Communication and
Information (MINCI), but is run as an autonomous service.[1] It reports on
national and regional issues, as well as on Latin America in general.

AVN was re-founded in 2005 by the Ministry of Communication and Information
(MCI) as the _Agencia Bolivariana de Noticias_ (ABN). Its predecessor was the
news agency Venpres,[2] which had been founded on 23 May 1977.[3] On 20 June
2010 ABN was renamed to AVN.[3]

In October, 2008, Venezuelan minister Andr√©s Izarra declared in an interview
at Radio Nacional de Venezuela that ABN will be converted into a state owned
corporation under the name "Agencia Venezolana de Noticias"(AVN). He said,
this is the result of an investigation about the working conditions, and that
the conversion shall increase the chances of ABN employees on the job
market.[1][4]
