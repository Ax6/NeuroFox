**Mang Inasal Philippines, Inc.** , also known as **Mang Inasal** ,
(Hiligaynon for "Mr. Barbecue") is a barbecue fast food restaurant chain in
the Philippines, established in Iloilo City in 2003.

The company was started by Edgar Sia, who owned his first business at the age
of twenty. Sia engaged in the food business at twenty-six years of age,
opening the first Mang Inasal branch in December 2003 at the Robinsons Mall
Carpark in Iloilo City. The restaurant was an instant success, despite stiff
competition from other, more established grilled-food restaurants.

The chain opened its first branches within the Visayan region, then expanded
to neighboring Mindanao to the south before spreading to Metro Manila.
Thereafter, the company started franchising in 2005. By 2008, Mang Inasal had
opened 23 restaurants, with ten being franchised.[2]

In October 2010, 70% of Mang Inasal was acquired by Jollibee Foods Corporation
(JFC), for â‚±3 billion ($68.8 million).[3] In April 2016, JFC (Jollibee Food
Corporation) acquired the remaining 30% previously belonging to Injap
Investment which is owned by Inasal's founder.[4]
