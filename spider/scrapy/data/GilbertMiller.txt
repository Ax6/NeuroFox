**Gilbert Heron Miller** (July 3, 1884 - January 3, 1969) was an American
theatrical producer.

Born in New York City, he was the son of English-born theatrical producer
Henry Miller (1859–1926) and Bijou Heron, a former child actress. Raised and
educated in Europe, he returned home to follow in his father's footsteps and
became a highly successful Broadway producer. Miller served as director of the
League of New York Theatres as well as an officer of the Actors Fund. He also
managed the St James's Theatre in London.

Nominated three times, Gilbert Miller won the Tony Award for Best Play in 1950
for his production of "The Cocktail Party." In 1965, he was given a Special
Tony Award "for having produced 88 plays and musicals and for his perseverance
which has helped to keep New York and theatre alive."

Gilbert Miller died in 1969 and was interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery in The
Bronx, New York.[1]

Miller's first wife was Jessie F. Glendinning, whom he divorced. She was an
actress and the daughter of the actor John Glendinning, and the sister of
Ernest Glendinning. They had one daughter, Dorothy.

His second wife was Mary Margaret Allen; they divorced.

His third wife was Kathryn (Kitty) Bache (1896–1979), a daughter of the Wall
Street financier Jules Bache, a supporter of American theatre who in 1941
helped found the New York branch of the Escholier Club. They married in 1927
