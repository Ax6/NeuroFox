**TKK Fried Chicken** is a Taiwanese chain of fried chicken restaurants.[1]
Outside its Taiwan locations, TKK also has branches in China and the United
States. TKK opened its first restaurant on 20 July 1974, in Ximending located
in Taipei City. On 2 November 2013, TKK opened its first gastropub, TKK the
BAR, in the Eastern District of Taipei to serve items from the original menu
as well as other products exclusive to the bar, thereby becoming one of the
only few fried chicken restaurants in the world to also operate a
gastropub.[1][2]
