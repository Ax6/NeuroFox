**TVN** (stylized as **tvN** ; formerly known as **Channel M** ) is a
Southeast Asian pay television channel managed by CJ E&M. It broadcasts a
variety of South Korean TV series from TV channels operated by CJ E&M (which
includes the South Korean channel of the same name, as well as Mnet, OCN and
others), with a number of original shows made for the Southeast Asian version.
The channel is distributed by Fox Networks Group Asia Pacific, a subsidiary of
Walt Disney Direct-to-Consumer & International, except the Philippines, where
it is distributed by Creative Programs of ABS-CBN Corporation.[1][2][3]

The channel was closed down in Vietnam on 2 July 2018 (as tvBlue) due to the
company's wrong development strategy and editorial team.

The channel was launched on 26 October 2009 as TVN and was later rebranded as
Channel M on 23 November 2012.[4][5] It was later rebranded back to TVN on 3
June 2016.[6]
