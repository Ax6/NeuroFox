**SFC,** also known as **Southern Fried Chicken,**[1] is a British-based fast
food outlet. It operates a franchise network in the United Kingdom and
worldwide. Southern Fried Chicken and its products can be found in over 700
locations, across over 79 countries.

Southern Fried Chicken was founded in the 1970s by Arthur Withers.[2] In 1973,
Withers travelled to America to work for Barbeque King; there, he improved his
knowledge of the commercial fast food business. Withers made a visit to
Greenville, South Carolina, where he learned about fried chicken.[3]

In 1983, Southern Fried Chicken moved into the offices they are still in
today, complete with its own manufacturing department.

In 1999, Southern Fried Chicken met an Alendvic Company and started to expand
the love of fried chicken in Russia, starting in the Perm region. The Perm
region now has over 25 outlets.

The company is currently headed by his son, Andrew Withers.[4]

Southern Fried Chicken is currently sold in over 700 locations, across over 79
countries worldwide. Restaurants have schemed interior designs and have been
applied to create clean, spacious and comfortable restaurants. Designs are
suited to all types of premises and existing architecture.

Southern Fried Chicken operates in areas that cover Europe, Arabia, Mena
regions, Africa and South America; as well as India, which includes the Asia-
Pac regions. They are also making the first steps to reach the Chinese Market.

The most recent outlet openings include Hyderabad and Mongolia as well as
having existing franchises in Senegal and Malta and a mobile unit in
Martinique and Central African Republic.

In July 2011, Andrew Withers took part in the Channel 4 documentary series
_Undercover Boss_ , where he went undercover to work at various franchises in
the United Kingdom.[5]
