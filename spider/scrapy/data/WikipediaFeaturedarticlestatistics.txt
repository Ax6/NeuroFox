**A** The discrepancy between articles promoted and demoted in August 2016 is
due to Harold and Inge Marcus Department of Industrial and Manufacturing
Engineering being merged into Penn State College of Engineering per
Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Harold and Inge Marcus Department of
Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, thus decremented the FA count by 1
without a FAR-generated demotion.

**B** The unusually large increase in the number of articles in March 2015 was
caused by a maintenance script running for the first time on 29 March. The
purpose of the maintenance script was to correct the automatically updated
count, which was missing roughly 95,000 articles. Since the maintenance script
will run on the 29th of each month from now on, the reported count should stay
much closer to the true count. See note for more information.

**C** The month-end total FAs listed for March 2013 through October 2014 do
not match the number listed in this table because of two errors [1] [2] that
were found and corrected in November 2014.[3] The numbers in this table are
audited and correct; the numbers in the linked diffs at month-end were
incorrect.
